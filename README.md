# Machine Learning Model Evaluation and Comparison

This project explores and compares multiple machine learning algorithms for predictive modeling tasks using structured data. It leverages various popular classifiers and regressors from `scikit-learn` and `xgboost`, with techniques such as train-test splitting, hyperparameter tuning, and performance evaluation.

## Features

- Data preprocessing and visualization using `pandas` and `matplotlib`
- Supervised learning models:
  - Decision Tree (Classifier & Regressor)
  - Random Forest Classifier
  - Logistic Regression
  - XGBoost Regressor
- Hyperparameter tuning using `GridSearchCV`
- Model evaluation and comparison

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries:
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`
  - `matplotlib`
